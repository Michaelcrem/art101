	<h1>Hello World</h1>

	<p>I'm Michael Cremonini and I'm currently attending UCSC as a Film and Digital Media Major with an Emphasis in Digital Media. My current interests consist of video production, product design, website layout, illustration, and UI/UX design. I've recently worked as a website designer for a small nonprofit foundation called, 'The United Black Family Scholarship Foundation.' I'm currently a marketing coordinator and realtor for Vista Properties Inc. in Capitola, Ca. I hope to expand my focus on design and put my skills into something that can help me blossom into the best designer that ever lived!
