Some or all instruction for all or part of Academic Year 20-21 may be delivered remotely. Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year.

It is not possible to know at this time whether the COVID-19 pandemic will result in changes to operations in student housing and residential life in Academic Year 2020-2021. Consequently, we are not offering a housing guarantee.
