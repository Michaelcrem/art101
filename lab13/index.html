		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>What was challenging was getting our jquery to show underneath the output.
      It was challenging trying to configure our jquery by creating a long string that would be able to show underneath our output.</p>

</div>



<div id="problems">
    <h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>We ran into problems creating a string.
      We used the provided example but we were a little lost during the part where we had to create new Dom elements.
      Also we kept on running into errors in the console that read, "Error defining variable".
       We then ended up being able to define the right variable and we were able to correctly create our long string by using the provided first method on canvas.
    Jquery is still a little confusing to understand but we're learning! </p>
</div>


<div id="results">
  <h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Here is our finished result for lab 13. We created a loop after we used a similar Fizzbuz function that we created in class!
  We were able to create a long string that would be pushed to our output.
  As you can see, we made it loop through 1-200. Then (fizz!) displays after a number that's a multiple of 3. Then (buzz!) if it's a multiple of 5. Then (boom!) if it's a multiple of 7. Lastly, if it's a multiple of more than 3, 5, and 7, then it will produce (fizzbuzz!)  </p>
