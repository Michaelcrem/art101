		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>There weren't that many challenges that we encountered. We were able to refer to the lecture demonstrations which was super helpful.
      Overall, we worked with similar material that we learned form past labs and it was not that hard.</p>
</div>



<div id="problems">
    <h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The problems that we ran into were very minor. It was mostly realted to configruing our jquery since we are both brand new to editing with this method.
      We used the console to find the area where we went wrong. It was an unclosed braket. Once we resolved the problem, all our code ran perfectly.  </p>
</div>


<div id="results">
  <h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Here is our finished lab 11.
    As you can see, we have added three buttons to each section. Each button has a different message than the other.
    In order to create this, we made three separate divs for each section and assigned each different button a separate click function.
    If you click from top to bottom, starting first with the Challenges section and ending with the Results section, you will see alerts that will tell you a story.</p>
