		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>It was a bit challenging for us to understand this new concept of creating functions and arrays.
      Though we did test it in the repl.it website, it was still hard to grasp how our JS code could shift from function to array.
      It was also a bit tricky getting the right stylization in our CSS for our source output to fit correctly into our image.
      We worked around that and we were able to tweak the sizing even though with bigger names, the new generated name could fit outside of the image.

  <h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Here is our finished index file for lab 7.
    This lab was a bit challenging because me and my partner are still trying to fulling grasp how to make arrays and functions.
    Originally, we didn't want to use this idea of shuffling the name into a newly generated one.
    We wanted to make a pop up that asked the user to include their name an email address and the message would return that the user has been hacked.
    We felt that this idea did not fulfill the requirment of data manipulation. So we used the same idea used in the example to finish the lab.
		A screenshot of our codeing will be provided in our lab submission. </p>
