		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>One challenge that we encountered was declaring our variables in our console. At first, we forgot the right steps to make an array but we were able to figure it out after looking up the steps in canvas. A challenge that we experienced was configuring our JS file within our index.html file.
			We eventually resolved the problem by looking over for mistakes in our JS file and we were able to find a missing closing braketet at the end of br.
			Another mistake that we had in our JS file were some missing semi colens and periods that would keep us from pushing our source output onto our site.


		</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Here is our finished index file for lab 6.
		In this file, we were able to create text within our borders so that it could be visually pleasing. We were able to link the javascript and CSS that we created.
		Within our javascript, we created an array of information about our prefered choice of transportation. It's a Dodge Charger!
		Any problems that came, we were able to resolve them by double checking our code in our javascript file and in our index file. We also used the inspect tool which helped us stylize our CSS.
		A screenshot of our codeing will be provided in our lab submission. </p>
