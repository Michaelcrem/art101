		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We had some challenges trying to create our success function but we were able to refer to the lecture for guidance.
    We did run into some other challenges/ problems like our uncaught token error which I will talk about in the next Problems section.</p>





    <h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Here we ran into an unexpected token error.
      We had an extra bracket next to our alt function and next to Get text. Once we resolved that issue, we were able to get our code to connect under our output div.</p>




  <h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Here are our reults for our lab 16 page. This was similar to the last lab that we created but this time, we were able to include a success function underneath our ajax.
    Inside our success callback function, we named our section titles under image, title and alt. </p>



	<h3>Output</h3>
	<button id="api-button">DO YOU EVEN API, BRO?</button>

	<div id="output"></div>
