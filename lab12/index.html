		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>There were no challenges but we still want more practice since this is a new topic.
       This free resource helped us greatly in completing the lab.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>There were no problems but we did run into a small problem adding our input and output into our HTML.
      Other than we did not run into any problems.</p>

<div id="results">
  <h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Here is our finished lab 12. We were able to write in our input and output id's and complete our javascript file.
    We built the house arrays and then we configured our return functions to return the name a string after hitting the submit button.</p>
