		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>There weren't that many challenges that we encountered. Thanks to the console, we were able to debug and fix our lab 10.</p>





    <h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Again, we did not have any problems and we were able to complete the debug without running into any problems. This lab was pretty straight forward and was a complete breeze.</p>




  <h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Our results are pictured at the bottom. We debugged lab 10 and made it more visually appealing than before. Read below for the full descrition of what we did to debug our lab 10. </p>


  <h2>Debugging</h2>
  <p>Here is our finished lab 14.
    As you can see, we have three sections along with our debugging section with our screenshots. We used the console to help us figure out our problem and the problem was in our class section for our output.
     We were able to fix our problem with the output font and we made our output show in a clear font that showcased on the name badge. We debugged this because our lab 10 before was not so visually pleasing as it is now. </p>
